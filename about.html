      Hello, I'm Ethan Krieg, a former Recruiter based in St. Louis, Missouri. During my time as a
      Technical Recruiter, I specialized in staffing Engineers for major companies including Boeing,
      General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin.  This experience ignited my passion for the
      tech industry, particularly in software development. Now, I am focused on transitioning my skills
      and expertise into a career in Full Stack Web development, leveraging my understanding of the
      industry and my recruitment background to excel in this field.
